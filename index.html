	<h1>Calls with C.K.</h1>
	
	<p>Around June 2021, C.K. offered to mentor me in working professionally.
	Here's a lesson I learned from him.
	
	<h2><span>Avoid Stepping on Toes</span></h2>
	<div class="instant">2021 July 17</div>
	<p>When joining a new team, first find out where all the toes are at, then avoid
	stepping on them. Here's a possible script to use with your new teammates:
	
	<h3>Possible script</h3>
	<p>"Hey, may I speak candidly? Because of [ reasons ] I won't be at this team, long-term. 
	Until then I will do my best in [ description of job ]. At the same time, I'd like to
	learn as much as I can about our company.
	
	<p>"In order to learn about [ company ] I'd like to explore all the git repositories, and
	read all the documentation that I can. In the process of doing this, I may offend someone by,
	for example, [ three examples of things that may cause offense ]
	(<a href="#footnote-1-src">some examples</a>). 
	Please tell me about other situations that would be frowned upon."
	
	<hr />
	
	<h3>Footnotes</h3>
	<p id="footnote-1-dest"><a href="#footnote-1-src">some examples</a> At my current employer the 
	example offenses could be, 1) Storing the personally identifiable information of customers on my
	work laptop, 2) Yelling at our shared manager, and 3) Accidentally causing the internal app 
	we work on to go down in PROD.
