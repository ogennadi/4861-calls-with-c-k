	<h1>Calls with Casey</h1>
	
	<p>Around June 2021, C.K. offered to mentor me in working professionally.
	Here's a lesson I learned from him</p>
	
	<h2><span>2021 July 17</span><span>Avoid Stepping on Toes</span></h2>
	<p>When joining a new team, first find out where all the toes are at, then avoid
	stepping on them. Here's a possible script to use with your new teammates
	
	<h3>Possible script</h3>
	<p>"Hey, may I speak candidly? Because of [ reasons ] I won't be at this team, long-term. 
	Until then I will do my best in [ description of job ]. At the same time, I'd like to
	learn as much as I can about our company.
	
	<p> In order to learn about [ company ] I'd like to explore all the git repositories, and
	read all the documentation that I can. In the process of doing this, I may offend someone by,
	for example, [ 3 examples of things that may cause offense ](<a href="#footnote-1">some examples</a>). 
	Please tell me about other situations that would be frowned upon.
	
	
	<p id="footnote-1">At Chewy the example offenses could be, 1) Storing PII on my
	work laptop, 2) Yelling at our manager Praveen, and 3) Accidentally taking the Dash app down in PROD.
